# Customer Conversion Prediction for Targeted Marketing

## Overview
This project develops a machine learning model to predict customer response to a marketing campaign using a real-world banking dataset. The goal is to identify high-probability customers and support more efficient, data-driven marketing strategies.

The model achieves approximately *80–85% accuracy*, demonstrating strong predictive performance and the ability to capture key drivers of customer behavior.


## Objectives
- ⁠Analyze customer and campaign data
- ⁠Identify key factors influencing conversion
- ⁠Build a predictive model for customer response
- ⁠Generate actionable insights for marketing optimization


## Dataset
* ⁠Source: UCI / Kaggle Bank Marketing Dataset  
* ⁠Size: 45,000+ customer records  


## Tools & Technologies
* ⁠Python  
* ⁠Pandas, NumPy  
* ⁠Scikit-learn  
* ⁠Matplotlib  
* ⁠Jupyter Notebook  


## Methodology

### 1. Exploratory Data Analysis
- ⁠Examined customer demographics and campaign variables
- ⁠Identified class imbalance in target variable
- ⁠Analyzed relationships between features and conversion

### 2. Feature Engineering
 * ⁠Created behavioral and campaign-based features:
  - Contact intensity
  - Financial pressure score
  - Campaign grouping

### 3. Modeling
* ⁠Trained a Random Forest classifier
* ⁠Evaluated using:
  - Accuracy
  - ROC AUC
  - Classification metrics


## Model Performance
-  ⁠Accuracy: 80–85%  
- ⁠Strong ROC AUC indicating good class separation  
- ⁠Balanced performance across classes  


## Key Insights

-  ⁠Customers with *longer call durations* are significantly more likely to convert  
- ⁠*Moderate campaign contact* performs better than excessive outreach  
- ⁠Customers with *previous interactions* show higher conversion rates  
- ⁠Behavioral and engagement features are strong predictors of response  


## Business Impact

This model enables:
- ⁠Prioritization of high-probability customers  
- ⁠Improved campaign targeting  
- ⁠Reduced marketing costs  
- ⁠Increased conversion efficiency  

By focusing on customers most likely to respond, organizations can optimize resource allocation and improve marketing ROI.


## Important Note

The model includes the ⁠ duration ⁠ variable, which significantly improves predictive performance. However, since this variable is only known after the call, it introduces post-contact information. In a real-world deployment, a pre-contact model would exclude this feature.


## How to Run

1.⁠ ⁠Download dataset from UCI/Kaggle  
2.⁠ ⁠Place ⁠ bank-full.csv ⁠ inside the ⁠ data/ ⁠ folder  
3.⁠ ⁠Run notebooks in order:
   - ⁠ 01_eda.ipynb ⁠
   - ⁠ 02_feature_engineering.ipynb ⁠
   - ⁠ 03_modeling.ipynb ⁠


## Future Improvements

* ⁠Build a pre-contact model excluding duration  
* ⁠Implement hyperparameter tuning  
* ⁠Develop a Power BI dashboard for business visualization  
* ⁠Deploy model as an API
